# TASK-1
    This is a simple c# console Application that demonstrates basic addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division operations.

# FEATURES
    * Perform addition of two  numbers
    * Perform Subtraction of two numbers
    * Perform Division of two numbers
    * Perform Multiplication of two numbers

# APPROACH 
    A Class named "MathUtils" was created, which took the variables that are passed from the main function. A method named Addition would perform addition of two variables that are passed from the main function. A method named Subtraction would perform subtraction of two variables that are passed from the main function. A method named Multiplication would perform multiplication of two variables that are passed from the main function. A method named Division would perform division of two variables that are passed from the main function.
    The main function would receive the user inputs in console.readline and pass it to the methods that are initiated. 

# CONCEPTS APPLIED

**User Input and Output**
    The program interacts with the user by prompting them to enter numbers. It utilizes c#'s 'Console.ReadLine()' to read input and 'Console.WriteLine()' to display output.

**Code Organization**

    The program follows a structured approach, with separate functions or methods for different tasks like addition,subtraction, Multiplication, Division. This promotes code readability, reusability, and maintainability.
    
**Error Handling**

    The program includes basic error handling to handle cases where the user enters invalid input, ensuring a smooth user experience and preventing crashes.


**METHODS:**

     A method is a block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Methods are declared within classes and can have parameters (input) and return values (output). 

     METHODS INCLUDED:
     * Addition
     * Subtraction
     * Multiplication
     * Division

**SYSTEM CONSOLE**

    ReadLine() and WriteLine() are methods provided by the System.Console class to read input from the user and write output to the console window, respectively. They are commonly used for interacting with the user through the command-line interface.

    * Console.ReadLine();
    * Console.WriteLine();

# Challenges

**PARSING INPUTES**

    While getting user inputs as integer, the parsing methods was applied incorrectly, then learnt by Utilizing methods like Parse() or TryParse() for converting user input to required data types. 

**EXPLORATION**

# CONCLUSION

    Overall it was a valuable learning experiance
